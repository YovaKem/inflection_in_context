the	_	_

being	_	_
willing	_	_
to	_	_
start	_	_
a	_	_

war	_	_
and	_	_
I	_	_
_	sympathise	_
with	_	_
the	_	_
Article	_	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
President	_	_
has	_	_
also	_	_
said	_	_
he	_	_
would	_	_
like	_	_
to	_	_
see	_	_
Israel	_	_
wiped	_	_
off	_	_
the	_	_
_	map	_
which	_	_
he	_	_
could	_	_
n't	_	_
even	_	_
begin	_	_
to	_	_
try	_	_
without	_	_
nuclear	_	_
weapons	_	_
.	_	_

But	_	_
he	_	_
has	_	_
insisted	_	_
that	_	_
he	_	_
_	want	_
nuclear	_	_
power	_	_
for	_	_
peaceful	_	_
purposes	_	_
.	_	_

Many	_	_
_	people	_
want	_	_
to	_	_
use	_	_
diplomacy	_	_
with	_	_
Iran	_	_
rather	_	_
than	_	_
military	_	_
pressure	_	_

We	_	_
do	_	_
n't	_	_
have	_	_

him	_	_

a	_	_
little	_	_
on	_	_
