now	_	_
that	_	_

those	_	_
three	_	_

,	_	_
and	_	_
not	_	_
always	_	_
are	_	_
their	_	_
_	decision	_
equal	_	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
US	_	_
has	_	_
strongly	_	_
opposed	_	_
a	_	_
nuclear	_	_
weapons	_	_
_	program	_
of	_	_
Iran	_	_
,	_	_
yet	_	_
Israel	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
to	_	_
this	_	_
_	day	_
has	_	_
never	_	_
officially	_	_
said	_	_
that	_	_
they	_	_
posses	_	_
nuclear	_	_
weapons	_	_
,	_	_
_	rank	_
around	_	_
fifth	_	_
in	_	_
nuclear	_	_
strength	_	_
.	_	_

It	_	_
is	_	_
estimated	_	_
that	_	_
Israel	_	_
_	have	_
over	_	_
200	_	_
nuclear	_	_
weapons	_	_
yet	_	_
neither	_	_
the	_	_
US	_	_
nor	_	_
any	_	_
of	_	_
her	_	_
_	ally	_
expresses	_	_
the	_	_
slightest	_	_
concern	_	_
.	_	_

North	_	_
Korea	_	_

Ill	_	_

_	have	_
the	_	_

top	_	_

Santa	_	_
seems	_	_
to	_	_
have	_	_
already	_	_
_	come	_
a	_	_
few	_	_
years	_	_
ago	_	_
.	_	_

It	_	_
is	_	_
_	rumor	_
that	_	_
North	_	_
Korea	_	_
has	_	_
at	_	_
least	_	_
a	_	_
_	couple	_
nuclear	_	_
weapons	_	_

But	_	_
_	get	_
past	_	_
who	_	_
should	_	_
get	_	_
them	_	_
,	_	_
is	_	_
who	_	_
_	have	_
them	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
who	_	_
is	_	_
really	_	_
close	_	_

The	_	_

of	_	_

Now	_	_
,	_	_
I	_	_
would	_	_
_	argue	_
that	_	_
one	_	_
could	_	_
have	_	_
reasonably	_	_
_	predict	_
that	_	_
some	_	_
form	_	_
of	_	_
military	_	_
violence	_	_
was	_	_
likely	_	_
to	_	_
_	occur	_
in	_	_
Lebanon	_	_
(	_	_
considering	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
country	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
experiencing	_	_
some	_	_
form	_	_
of	_	_
_	conflict	_
for	_	_
approximately	_	_
the	_	_
last	_	_
32	_	_
years	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

In	_	_
other	_	_
_	word	_
,	_	_
those	_	_
Americans	_	_
were	_	_
there	_	_
by	_	_
their	_	_
own	_	_
choice	_	_
,	_	_
_	mire	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
situation	_	_
that	_	_
was	_	_
totally	_	_
predictable	_	_
.	_	_

Yet	_	_
we	_	_
did	_	_
n't	_	_
_	charge	_
them	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
evacuation	_	_
.	_	_

This	_	_
is	_	_
unlike	_	_
the	_	_
situation	_	_
last	_	_
year	_	_
in	_	_
Asia	_	_
when	_	_
we	_	_
_	evacuate	_
U.S.	_	_
citizens	_	_
from	_	_
areas	_	_
that	_	_
were	_	_
_	hit	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
tsunami	_	_
a	_	_
phenomenon	_	_
that	_	_
is	_	_
much	_	_
less	_	_
predictable	_	_
than	_	_
the	_	_
Hezbollah	_	_
_	provoke	_
destruction	_	_
that	_	_
rained	_	_
down	_	_
on	_	_
Lebanon	_	_
.	_	_

And	_	_
what	_	_
do	_	_
we	_	_
_	get	_
for	_	_
this	_	_
effort	_	_
?	_	_

The	_	_

really	_	_
have	_	_

it	_	_
's	_	_
an	_	_

following	_	_

long	_	_
been	_	_
a	_	_
trenchant	_	_
_	critic	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
Sadrists	_	_

But	_	_
they	_	_
have	_	_
n't	_	_
been	_	_
up	_	_
to	_	_
anything	_	_
extraordinary	_	_
as	_	_
far	_	_
as	_	_
I	_	_
can	_	_
_	see	_
in	_	_
recent	_	_
weeks	_	_
.	_	_

Someone	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
CPA	_	_
_	sit	_
down	_	_
and	_	_
thought	_	_
up	_	_
ways	_	_
to	_	_
_	stir	_
them	_	_
up	_	_
by	_	_
closing	_	_
their	_	_
_	newspaper	_
and	_	_
issuing	_	_
28	_	_
arrest	_	_
warrants	_	_
and	_	_
_	take	_
in	_	_
people	_	_
like	_	_
Yaqubi	_	_
.	_	_

This	_	_
is	_	_
either	_	_
gross	_	_
incompetence	_	_
or	_	_
was	_	_
_	do	_
with	_	_
dark	_	_
ulterior	_	_
motives	_	_
that	_	_
can	_	_
scarcely	_	_
be	_	_
_	guess	_
at	_	_
.	_	_

There	_	_
is	_	_
a	_	_
classical	_	_
logical	_	_
fallacy	_	_
,	_	_
post	_	_
hoc	_	_
ergo	_	_
propter	_	_
hoc	_	_
(	_	_
Z	_	_
_	happen	_
after	_	_
X	_	_
,	_	_
therefore	_	_
Z	_	_
is	_	_
_	cause	_
by	_	_
X	_	_
)	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
I	_	_
_	keep	_
revising	_	_
this	_	_
posting	_	_
this	_	_
evening	_	_
because	_	_
I	_	_
do	_	_
n't	_	_
_	want	_
to	_	_
fall	_	_
into	_	_
it	_	_
.	_	_

But	_	_
sometimes	_	_
,	_	_
of	_	_
course	_	_
,	_	_
when	_	_
Z	_	_
_	happen	_
after	_	_
X	_	_
it	_	_

_	come	_
out	_	_

it	_	_

In	_	_

Peder	_	_

I	_	_
were	_	_

are	_	_
all	_	_
bark	_	_
and	_	_
no	_	_
_	bite	_

i	_	_

get	_	_
their	_	_
asses	_	_
kicked	_	_
by	_	_
_	cat	_
.	_	_

should	_	_

i	_	_
_	want	_
it	_	_
b/c	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
really	_	_
small	_	_
and	_	_
cute	_	_
.	_	_

i	_	_
knew	_	_
someone	_	_
in	_	_
college	_	_
who	_	_
_	have	_
one	_	_
and	_	_
i	_	_
loved	_	_
it	_	_
.	_	_

why	_	_
do	_	_
you	_	_
_	think	_
they	_	_
are	_	_
mean	_	_
?	_	_

why	_	_
would	_	_
you	_	_
_	want	_
a	_	_
chihuahua	_	_
?	_	_

those	_	_
_	dog	_
are	_	_
n't	_	_
even	_	_
friendly	_	_
.	_	_

do	_	_
you	_	_
_	think	_
they	_	_
are	_	_
cool	_	_
b/c	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
taco	_	_

It	_	_
is	_	_
my	_	_
understanding	_	_
,	_	_
from	_	_
good	_	_
_	source	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
Gov	_	_
s	_	_
office	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
Gov	_	_
will	_	_
order	_	_
Loretta	_	_
Lynch	_	_
to	_	_
expeditiously	_	_
_	implement	_
the	_	_
provision	_	_
to	_	_
suspend	_	_
all	_	_
_	party	_
auhtority	_	_
to	_	_
enter	_	_
into	_	_
direct	_	_
_	access	_
contracts	_	_

The	_	_
_	premise	_
with	_	_
which	_	_
the	_	_
administartion	_	_
is	_	_
_	act	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
if	_	_
they	_	_
expeditiously	_	_
suspend	_	_
everyone	_	_
's	_	_
_	right	_
to	_	_
bilateral	_	_
contracts	_	_
quickly	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
_	set	_
up	_	_
a	_	_
barrier	_	_
which	_	_
the	_	_
direct	_	_
access	_	_
coalition	_	_
must	_	_
_	break	_
through	_	_
.	_	_

In	_	_
other	_	_
_	word	_
the	_	_
table	_	_
is	_	_
set	_	_

I.E.	_	_
the	_	_
Davis	_	_
Administration	_	_
_	want	_
to	_	_
place	_	_
all	_	_
direct	_	_
access	_	_
advocates	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
position	_	_
of	_	_
_	have	_
to	_	_
justify	_	_
why	_	_
each	_	_
and	_	_
every	_	_
_	party	_
should	_	_
be	_	_
the	_	_
exception	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
suspension	_	_
rather	_	_
than	_	_
have	_	_
a	_	_
general	_	_

concerning	_	_
how	_	_
direct	_	_
access	_	_
should	_	_
_	work	_
for	_	_
all	_	_

_	think	_
of	_	_
converting	_	_
it	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
_	hover	_
vehicle	_	_

I	_	_
might	_	_
just	_	_
_	sell	_
the	_	_
car	_	_

get	_	_
you	_	_
to	_	_

about	_	_

for	_	_
the	_	_
_	front	_

on	_	_

_	move	_
seeking	_	_
affectionate	_	_
,	_	_
satisfying	_	_
and	_	_
harmonious	_	_
relationships	_	_
.	_	_

Your	_	_
ultimate	_	_
goal	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
the	_	_
realisation	_	_
of	_	_
an	_	_
intimate	_	_
union	_	_
in	_	_
which	_	_
there	_	_
could	_	_
be	_	_
love	_	_
,	_	_
_	self	_
sacrifice	_	_

mutual	_	_
trust	_	_

has	_	_
often	_	_
been	_	_
_	say	_

n't	_	_
_	find	_
it	_	_

still	_	_
are	_	_

greater	_	_

_	afford	_
you	_	_
considerable	_	_

I	_	_

December	_	_

giving	_	_
about	_	_
44,000	_	_

observations	_	_
.	_	_

However	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
_	result	_
from	_	_
Ordinary	_	_
Least	_	_
Squares	_	_
was	_	_
not	_	_
as	_	_
_	expect	_

to	_	_
different	_	_
sign	_	_

both	_	_

The	_	_
coefficient	_	_

are	_	_
as	_	_
followed	_	_
:	_	_

_	intercept	_

_	slope	_

Therefore	_	_
I	_	_
could	_	_
not	_	_
estimate	_	_
the	_	_

reversion	_	_
rate	_	_
as	_	_
the	_	_
estimated	_	_

I	_	_

the	_	_

_	regard	_
a	_	_
copy	_	_
of	_	_
an	_	_
article	_	_
.	_	_

This	_	_
is	_	_
the	_	_
best	_	_
solution	_	_
_	give	_
all	_	_
the	_	_
uncertainties	_	_
we	_	_
face	_	_
.	_	_

Thanks	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
message	_	_
regarding	_	_
a	_	_
possible	_	_
_	intern	_
for	_	_
your	_	_
group	_	_
.	_	_

Right	_	_
now	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
are	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
process	_	_
of	_	_
_	evaluate	_
both	_	_
our	_	_
new	_	_
hire	_	_
needs	_	_
and	_	_
our	_	_
summer	_	_
_	need	_
and	_	_
will	_	_
be	_	_
making	_	_
those	_	_
_	decision	_
after	_	_
the	_	_
first	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
year	_	_
.	_	_

Until	_	_
we	_	_
have	_	_
come	_	_
up	_	_
with	_	_
those	_	_
_	number	_
it	_	_
would	_	_
be	_	_
premature	_	_
to	_	_
make	_	_
any	_	_
offers	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
_	summer	_
.	_	_

What	_	_
I	_	_
would	_	_
_	like	_
to	_	_
do	_	_
in	_	_
this	_	_
case	_	_
is	_	_
_	get	_
the	_	_
information	_	_
to	_	_
Jeff	_	_
Davis	_	_
,	_	_
who	_	_
is	_	_
responsible	_	_
for	_	_
Georgia	_	_
Tech	_	_
and	_	_
_	ask	_
him	_	_
to	_	_
get	_	_
Sungjoo	_	_
's	_	_
resume	_	_
and	_	_
_	start	_
a	_	_
file	_	_
on	_	_
him	_	_
with	_	_
a	_	_
notation	_	_
that	_	_
you	_	_
would	_	_
_	like	_
to	_	_
hire	_	_
him	_	_
for	_	_
summer	_	_
.	_	_

When	_	_
we	_	_
_	start	_
the	_	_
summer	_	_
process	_	_
,	_	_
we	_	_
will	_	_
interview	_	_
the	_	_
candidate	_	_
and	_	_
_	slot	_
him	_	_
for	_	_
your	_	_
group	_	_
.	_	_

_	hope	_
all	_	_
is	_	_
well	_	_
with	_	_
you	_	_

I	_	_
have	_	_
_	visit	_
Georgia	_	_
Tech	_	_
on	_	_
Thursday	_	_
.	_	_

One	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
students	_	_
_	indicate	_
that	_	_
he	_	_
is	_	_
interested	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
_	summer	_
internship	_	_
.	_	_

He	_	_
_	come	_
across	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
very	_	_
bright	_	_
_	person	_
,	_	_
very	_	_

I	_	_
can	_	_
_	take	_
him	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
summer	_	_
intern	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
hope	_	_
you	_	_
_	have	_
a	_	_
good	_	_
flight	_	_
back	_	_
to	_	_
_	home	_
.	_	_

It	_	_
was	_	_
a	_	_
good	_	_
opportunity	_	_
to	_	_
know	_	_
about	_	_
Enron	_	_
and	_	_
its	_	_
_	finance	_
sector	_	_
.	_	_

_	thank	_
you	_	_
for	_	_
your	_	_
time	_	_

I	_	_
have	_	_
already	_	_
_	submit	_
my	_	_
resume	_	_

cover	_	_
letter	_	_
right	_	_
after	_	_
the	_	_
_	talk	_

However	_	_
,	_	_
you	_	_
_	ask	_
me	_	_

Those	_	_

are	_	_
what	_	_
I	_	_
was	_	_
_	ask	_

Again	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
was	_	_
a	_	_
good	_	_
_	chance	_
for	_	_
me	_	_
to	_	_
get	_	_
to	_	_
_	know	_
what	_	_
I	_	_
can	_	_
do	_	_
in	_	_
this	_	_

what	_	_
I	_	_
have	_	_
to	_	_
more	_	_
_	focus	_
on	_	_
in	_	_

I	_	_

Frequent	_	_
travelers	_	_
and	_	_
executives	_	_
are	_	_
among	_	_
the	_	_
_	mass	_
that	_	_
get	_	_
a	_	_
lot	_	_
of	_	_
_	discount	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
airfare	_	_
.	_	_

It	_	_
is	_	_
easy	_	_
to	_	_
_	get	_
discount	_	_
airfare	_	_
for	_	_
them	_	_
since	_	_
they	_	_
_	travel	_
very	_	_
frequently	_	_
.	_	_

Some	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
corporate	_	_
also	_	_
_	get	_
cheap	_	_
air	_	_
tickets	_	_
because	_	_
they	_	_
_	tie	_
up	_	_
with	_	_
some	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
airlines	_	_
for	_	_
a	_	_
certain	_	_
_	period	_
based	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
discount	_	_
and	_	_
_	service	_
they	_	_
get	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
airlines	_	_

Corporate	_	_
plans	_	_
are	_	_
_	club	_
with	_	_
other	_	_
services	_	_
through	_	_
some	_	_
agencies	_	_
to	_	_
provide	_	_
better	_	_
_	service	_
for	_	_
their	_	_
staff	_	_
.	_	_

Some	_	_
countries	_	_
like	_	_
Malaysia	_	_
and	_	_
Singapore	_	_
_	promote	_
trading	_	_
for	_	_
foreign	_	_
visitors	_	_
during	_	_
some	_	_
_	part	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
year	_	_

During	_	_
this	_	_
period	_	_
,	_	_
they	_	_
offer	_	_
cheap	_	_
_	air	_
tickets	_	_
to	_	_
their	_	_
country	_	_
on	_	_
certain	_	_
_	flight	_

If	_	_
you	_	_
can	_	_
_	check	_
with	_	_
the	_	_
other	_	_
airlines	_	_
during	_	_
this	_	_
_	period	_
,	_	_
you	_	_
may	_	_
get	_	_
excellent	_	_
discount	_	_
airfare	_	_
,	_	_
which	_	_
may	_	_
even	_	_
_	surprise	_
you	_	_
.	_	_

Several	_	_
years	_	_
ago	_	_
I	_	_
_	develop	_
a	_	_
short	_	_
paper	_	_
and	_	_
pencil	_	_
screening	_	_
_	test	_
which	_	_
,	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
small	_	_
pilot	_	_
study	_	_
,	_	_
_	discriminate	_
between	_	_
ADHD	_	_
,	_	_
LD	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
_	control	_
subjects	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
recently	_	_
converted	_	_
this	_	_
_	test	_
to	_	_
an	_	_
online	_	_
test	_	_
in	_	_
order	_	_
to	_	_
_	norm	_
it	_	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
larger	_	_
population	_	_
and	_	_
,	_	_
subsequently	_	_
,	_	_
to	_	_
_	make	_
it	_	_
available	_	_
to	_	_
any	_	_
one	_	_
who	_	_
has	_	_
_	access	_
to	_	_
a	_	_
computer	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
Internet	_	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
_	test	_
itself	_	_
is	_	_
what	_	_
is	_	_
called	_	_
a	_	_
substitution	_	_
_	test	_
.	_	_

It	_	_
_	have	_
two	_	_
parts	_	_
,	_	_
both	_	_
of	_	_
which	_	_
are	_	_
_	time	_
for	_	_
90	_	_
seconds	_	_
each	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
differential	_	_
between	_	_
the	_	_
_	result	_
two	_	_
scores	_	_
determines	_	_
the	_	_
likelihood	_	_
of	_	_
_	have	_
a	_	_
learning	_	_
disability	_	_
or	_	_
attention	_	_
deficit	_	_
disorder	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
am	_	_
in	_	_
need	_	_
of	_	_
_	test	_
subjects	_	_
and	_	_
hope	_	_
you	_	_
will	_	_
_	take	_
it	_	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
_	test	_
,	_	_
along	_	_
with	_	_
an	_	_
information	_	_
_	form	_
,	_	_
is	_	_
available	_	_
at	_	_

.	_	_

I	_	_
_	think	_
a	_	_
test	_	_
like	_	_
this	_	_
one	_	_
is	_	_
much	_	_
_	need	_
.	_	_

A	_	_
_	person	_
can	_	_
take	_	_
it	_	_
directly	_	_
instead	_	_
of	_	_
_	other	_
completing	_	_
behavioral	_	_
checklists	_	_
or	_	_
a	_	_
completing	_	_

Once	_	_

a	_	_
_	time	_
(	_	_
in	_	_

_	build	_
a	_	_
bottling	_	_
plant	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
small	_	_
and	_	_
remote	_	_
Indian	_	_
village	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
_	state	_
of	_	_
Kerala	_	_
.	_	_

In	_	_
exchange	_	_
for	_	_
sucking	_	_
vast	_	_
_	amount	_
of	_	_
water	_	_
out	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
local	_	_
_	land	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
mighty	_	_
corporation	_	_
promised	_	_
to	_	_
bring	_	_
the	_	_
_	people	_
great	_	_
wealth	_	_
.	_	_

But	_	_
within	_	_
a	_	_
few	_	_
short	_	_
months	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
village	_	_
_	people	_
began	_	_
to	_	_
notice	_	_
their	_	_
wells	_	_
were	_	_
_	run	_
dry	_	_
,	_	_
so	_	_
they	_	_
complained	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
corporation	_	_
.	_	_

Coca	_	_
Cola	_	_
calmed	_	_
the	_	_
_	concern	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
people	_	_
and	_	_
attempted	_	_
to	_	_
_	win	_
back	_	_
their	_	_
favor	_	_
by	_	_
giving	_	_
them	_	_
vast	_	_
_	amount	_
of	_	_
free	_	_
fertilizer	_	_
,	_	_
saying	_	_
it	_	_
would	_	_
grow	_	_
bountiful	_	_
_	crop	_
beyond	_	_
their	_	_
wildest	_	_
dreams	_	_
.	_	_

After	_	_
several	_	_
years	_	_
of	_	_

,	_	_
we	_	_
arrive	_	_
at	_	_
the	_	_
present	_	_
_	day	_
when	_	_
the	_	_
village	_	_
people	_	_
have	_	_
suddenly	_	_
_	discover	_
the	_	_
fertilizer	_	_
is	_	_
actually	_	_
the	_	_
bottling	_	_
_	plant	_
's	_	_
waste	_	_
sludge	_	_
and	_	_
is	_	_
laden	_	_

highly	_	_
toxic	_	_
,	_	_
cancer	_	_

heavy	_	_
metal	_	_

The	_	_
village	_	_
_	soil	_
and	_	_
water	_	_
are	_	_
now	_	_
too	_	_
heavily	_	_
_	contaminate	_
to	_	_
safely	_	_
occupy	_	_
human	_	_
life	_	_
,	_	_
so	_	_
the	_	_

was	_	_
shut	_	_
down	_	_

Abbas	_	_
,	_	_
a	_	_
_	refugee	_
himself	_	_
from	_	_
what	_	_
is	_	_
today	_	_
the	_	_
northern	_	_

personally	_	_

I	_	_
can	_	_

The	_	_

militant	_	_
organisation	_	_
Hamas	_	_
has	_	_
_	announce	_
an	_	_
end	_	_
to	_	_
rocket	_	_
attacks	_	_
on	_	_
Israel	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
Gaza	_	_

after	_	_
a	_	_
weekend	_	_
of	_	_
_	escalate	_
violence	_	_
.	_	_

Up	_	_

been	_	_

weeks	_	_
after	_	_
its	_	_
military	_	_
_	withdraw	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
territory	_	_
.	_	_

In	_	_
response	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
rockets	_	_
,	_	_
Israel	_	_
resumed	_	_
its	_	_
_	policy	_

It	_	_

has	_	_

in	_	_

_	help	_
findin	_	_
a	_	_
restaurant	_	_
for	_	_
anniversary	_	_
in	_	_
SF	_	_
?	_	_

It	_	_
's	_	_
my	_	_
two	_	_
year	_	_
anniversary	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
few	_	_
_	day	_
and	_	_
was	_	_
wondering	_	_
if	_	_
somone	_	_
could	_	_
_	tell	_
me	_	_
about	_	_
a	_	_
great	_	_
restaurant	_	_
in	_	_
sf	_	_
or	_	_
other	_	_
nearby	_	_
cities	_	_

I	_	_
_	like	_
Hayes	_	_
Street	_	_
Grill	_	_
....	_	_
another	_	_
_	plus	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
's	_	_
right	_	_
by	_	_
Civic	_	_
Center	_	_
,	_	_
so	_	_
you	_	_
can	_	_
_	take	_
a	_	_
romantic	_	_
walk	_	_
around	_	_
the	_	_
Opera	_	_
House	_	_
,	_	_
City	_	_
Hall	_	_
,	_	_
Symphony	_	_
Auditorium	_	_
...	_	_
all	_	_
very	_	_
beautiful	_	_
.	_	_

What	_	_
would	_	_
happen	_	_
if	_	_
you	_	_
flew	_	_
the	_	_
_	flag	_
of	_	_
South	_	_
Vietnam	_	_
in	_	_
Modern	_	_
_	day	_
Vietnam	_	_
?	_	_

It	_	_
would	_	_
be	_	_
similar	_	_
to	_	_
_	fly	_
the	_	_
flag	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
Third	_	_
Reich	_	_
in	_	_
modern	_	_
_	day	_
Germany	_	_
or	_	_
in	_	_
Israel	_	_
.	_	_

You	_	_
would	_	_
be	_	_
_	violate	_
the	_	_
law	_	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
police	_	_
would	_	_
_	make	_
you	_	_
take	_	_
it	_	_
down	_	_
and	_	_
you	_	_
may	_	_
face	_	_
_	fine	_
and	_	_
imprisonment	_	_
(	_	_
but	_	_
definitely	_	_
not	_	_
execution	_	_
.	_	_
)	_	_

You	_	_
will	_	_
also	_	_
face	_	_
the	_	_
ire	_	_
of	_	_
most	_	_
_	people	_
there	_	_
.	_	_

They	_	_
might	_	_
be	_	_
imprisoned	_	_
or	_	_
_	execute	_

If	_	_
anyone	_	_
else	_	_
has	_	_
_	vote	_
?	_	_

Obviously	_	_
because	_	_
i	_	_
_	want	_
to	_	_
vote	_	_
.	_	_

And	_	_
if	_	_
anyone	_	_
else	_	_
has	_	_
voted	_	_
,	_	_
what	_	_
did	_	_
you	_	_
_	guy	_
vote	_	_
for	_	_
?	_	_

You	_	_
_	vote	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
Dominion	_	_
Posts	_	_
website	_	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
top	_	_
two	_	_

going	_	_

to	_	_

'	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
final	_	_
vote	_	_
on	_	_
that	_	_
_	open	_
on	_	_
Wednesday	_	_
on	_	_

They	_	_
should	_	_
_	have	_
one	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
All	_	_

_	try	_
Varkala	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
s	_	_
a	_	_
ammazing	_	_
and	_	_
is	_	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
_	beach	_
.	_	_

_	people	_
are	_	_
open	_	_
minded	_	_
thr	_	_
since	_	_
the	_	_
_	place	_
is	_	_
frequented	_	_
by	_	_
Firangs	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
_	have	_
a	_	_
male	_	_
and	_	_
female	_	_
cockatiel	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
there	_	_
are	_	_
2	_	_
eggs	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
_	bottom	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
cage	_	_
,	_	_
will	_	_
they	_	_
_	hatch	_

Most	_	_

not	_	_
,	_	_
if	_	_

is	_	_
not	_	_
a	_	_
bird	_	_
_	sit	_

the	_	_
eggs	_	_

This	_	_
is	_	_

Cockatiels	_	_
can	_	_
_	lay	_
unfertilized	_	_
eggs	_	_
as	_	_
well	_	_

Just	_	_
because	_	_

_	have	_
a	_	_
male	_	_
and	_	_
female	_	_
,	_	_
it	_	_
can	_	_
not	_	_
be	_	_
guaranteed	_	_
the	_	_
two	_	_
_	mate	_

You	_	_
can	_	_
_	try	_
picking	_	_
up	_	_
the	_	_
eggs	_	_
and	_	_
_	hold	_
it	_	_
up	_	_
against	_	_
a	_	_
very	_	_
bright	_	_

If	_	_
you	_	_
_	see	_
a	_	_
dark	_	_
spot	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
egg	_	_
,	_	_
that	_	_
_	mean	_
it	_	_

on	_	_
A	_	_
cruise	_	_
any	_	_
and	_	_
all	_	_
info	_	_
is	_	_
_	appreciate	_

Personally	_	_
,	_	_
I	_	_
do	_	_
n't	_	_
find	_	_
a	_	_
_	travel	_
agent	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
of	_	_
value	_	_
to	_	_
me	_	_
as	_	_
I	_	_
am	_	_
willing	_	_
to	_	_
_	put	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
time	_	_
doing	_	_
research	_	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
internet	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
have	_	_
not	_	_
had	_	_
good	_	_
_	experience	_
with	_	_
travel	_	_
agents	_	_
.	_	_

They	_	_
do	_	_
n't	_	_
_	seem	_
to	_	_
know	_	_
anything	_	_
but	_	_
the	_	_
_	hype	_
they	_	_
are	_	_
told	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
packages	_	_
they	_	_
_	have	_
available	_	_
to	_	_
them	_	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
_	one	_
time	_	_
I	_	_
actually	_	_
booked	_	_
through	_	_
a	_	_
_	travel	_
agent	_	_
I	_	_
did	_	_
not	_	_
get	_	_
all	_	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
amenities	_	_
I	_	_
had	_	_
_	pay	_
for	_	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
few	_	_
_	time	_
I	_	_
have	_	_
consulted	_	_
with	_	_
a	_	_
_	travel	_
agent	_	_
I	_	_
was	_	_
able	_	_
to	_	_
_	find	_
the	_	_
same	_	_
for	_	_
less	_	_
on	_	_
my	_	_
own	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
more	_	_
options	_	_
than	_	_
what	_	_
they	_	_
were	_	_
_	sell	_
.	_	_

So	_	_
now	_	_
I	_	_
do	_	_
not	_	_
_	bother	_
with	_	_
them	_	_
at	_	_
all	_	_
.	_	_

best	_	_
is	_	_
using	_	_
an	_	_
online	_	_
_	travel	_
agent	_	_

I	_	_
_	walk	_
down	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_
basement	_	_
and	_	_
it	_	_
was	_	_
as	_	_
big	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
_	rat	_
.	_	_

It	_	_
had	_	_
been	_	_
_	eat	_
dog	_	_
food	_	_
the	_	_
whole	_	_
time	_	_
.	_	_

It	_	_
was	_	_
huge	_	_
and	_	_
_	scare	_
the	_	_
crap	_	_
out	_	_
of	_	_
me	_	_
.	_	_

_	make	_
sure	_	_
he	_	_
is	_	_
n't	_	_
trapped	_	_
somewhere	_	_
&	_	_
_	put	_

Start	_	_

and	_	_
start	_	_
looking	_	_
.	_	_

can	_	_
i	_	_
have	_	_
some	_	_
indoor	_	_
_	pet	_
ideas	_	_
please	_	_
!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	_	_

i	_	_
_	want	_
a	_	_
small	_	_
indoor	_	_
pet	_	_
that	_	_
my	_	_
_	mother	_
will	_	_
let	_	_
me	_	_
have	_	_
please	_	_
_	help	_

i	_	_
_	want	_
something	_	_
cheap	_	_
east	_	_
to	_	_
take	_	_
_	care	_
of	_	_
and	_	_
something	_	_
to	_	_
hopefully	_	_
fit	_	_
in	_	_
my	_	_
_	room	_

no	_	_
_	pet	_
is	_	_
really	_	_
easy	_	_
to	_	_
take	_	_
_	care	_
of	_	_
.	_	_

they	_	_
all	_	_
need	_	_
_	love	_
and	_	_
attn	_	_
,	_	_
food	_	_
,	_	_
proper	_	_
surroundings	_	_
etc	_	_
.	_	_

the	_	_
easiest	_	_
thing	_	_
would	_	_
be	_	_
a	_	_
_	fish	_
but	_	_
u	_	_
need	_	_
to	_	_
clean	_	_
the	_	_
_	tank	_
weekly	_	_
,	_	_
feed	_	_
it	_	_
the	_	_
right	_	_
amt	_	_
,	_	_
etc	_	_
etc	_	_
x	_	_

_	have	_
a	_	_
pet	_	_
is	_	_
n't	_	_
easy	_	_
.	_	_

You	_	_
should	_	_
treat	_	_
all	_	_
_	pet	_
like	_	_
children	_	_
.	_	_

They	_	_
_	require	_
a	_	_
lot	_	_
of	_	_
attention	_	_
or	_	_
they	_	_
get	_	_
fussy	_	_
and	_	_
_	tear	_
stuff	_	_
up	_	_
.	_	_

If	_	_
you	_	_
want	_	_
easy	_	_
then	_	_
_	go	_
with	_	_
a	_	_
gold	_	_
fish	_	_
or	_	_
hamster	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
would	_	_
_	go	_
with	_	_
a	_	_
small	_	_
rodent	_	_
such	_	_
as	_	_
a	_	_
mouse	_	_
,	_	_
_	rat	_
,	_	_
hamster	_	_
or	_	_
gerbil	_	_
if	_	_
you	_	_
_	want	_
something	_	_
you	_	_
can	_	_
handle	_	_
and	_	_
_	hold	_
.	_	_

_	fish	_
are	_	_
probably	_	_
the	_	_
easiest	_	_
to	_	_
take	_	_
_	care	_
of	_	_
though	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
ve	_	_
been	_	_
_	date	_
a	_	_
man	_	_
from	_	_
brittany	_	_
france	_	_
for	_	_
a	_	_
_	couple	_
of	_	_
months	_	_
now	_	_
.	_	_

He	_	_
's	_	_
been	_	_
away	_	_
for	_	_
a	_	_
week	_	_
and	_	_
I	_	_
was	_	_
thinking	_	_
of	_	_
_	wait	_
for	_	_
him	_	_
in	_	_
his	_	_
apartment	_	_
wearing	_	_
only	_	_
his	_	_
dress	_	_
_	shirt	_
.	_	_

It	_	_
s	_	_
still	_	_
a	_	_
fairly	_	_
new	_	_
relationship	_	_
and	_	_
we	_	_
have	_	_
nt	_	_
_	have	_
sex	_	_
yet	_	_
so	_	_
it	_	_
s	_	_
kind	_	_
of	_	_
a	_	_
big	_	_
_	deal	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
just	_	_
do	_	_
nt	_	_
_	want	_
to	_	_
freak	_	_
him	_	_
out	_	_
or	_	_
_	make	_
him	_	_
feel	_	_
uncomfortable	_	_
.	_	_

Is	_	_
it	_	_
ok	_	_
for	_	_
a	_	_
woman	_	_
in	_	_
french	_	_
_	culture	_
to	_	_
make	_	_
the	_	_
first	_	_
move	_	_

What	_	_
do	_	_
french	_	_
men	_	_
_	find	_
sexy	_	_
?	_	_

French	_	_
women	_	_
are	_	_
the	_	_
ones	_	_
to	_	_
_	say	_
yes	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
way	_	_
we	_	_
_	say	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
not	_	_
usually	_	_
as	_	_
straigthforward	_	_
as	_	_
you	_	_
_	propose	_
to	_	_
do	_	_
.	_	_

Why	_	_
not	_	_
_	wait	_
for	_	_
him	_	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
sexy	_	_
_	dress	_
with	_	_
lunch	_	_

,	_	_
or	_	_
a	_	_
light	_	_
_	snack	_
at	_	_
his	_	_
house	_	_
.	_	_

And	_	_
you	_	_
_	take	_
it	_	_
up	_	_
from	_	_
there	_	_
.	_	_

Just	_	_
_	make	_
sure	_	_
that	_	_
it	_	_
is	_	_
a	_	_
light	_	_

20	_	_

compared	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_
others	_	_
in	_	_

they	_	_

And	_	_

seem	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_

at	_	_
fairly	_	_
regular	_	_
intervals	_	_

We	_	_
_	go	_
to	_	_
Japaneiro	_	_
's	_	_
all	_	_
the	_	_
_	time	_
and	_	_
we	_	_
have	_	_
NEVER	_	_
been	_	_

and	_	_
always	_	_
courteous	_	_
!	_	_

He	_	_
is	_	_
very	_	_
knowledgeable	_	_
and	_	_
took	_	_
the	_	_
time	_	_
to	_	_
_	explain	_
the	_	_

to	_	_

The	_	_
work	_	_
on	_	_
my	_	_
car	_	_
was	_	_
_	do	_
quickly	_	_
and	_	_
I	_	_
felt	_	_
I	_	_
could	_	_
_	trust	_
his	_	_
work	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
_	have	_
nothing	_	_
but	_	_
fantastic	_	_
things	_	_
to	_	_
_	say	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
highly	_	_
recommend	_	_
his	_	_
_	shop	_
.	_	_

This	_	_
_	shop	_
is	_	_
by	_	_
far	_	_
the	_	_
best	_	_
I	_	_
have	_	_
been	_	_
to	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
_	have	_
a	_	_
Saab	_	_
...	_	_
which	_	_
everything	_	_
is	_	_
expensive	_	_
on	_	_
and	_	_
they	_	_
have	_	_
been	_	_
extrememly	_	_
fair	_	_
and	_	_
_	price	_
a	_	_
lot	_	_
lower	_	_
than	_	_
any	_	_
other	_	_
_	shop	_
I	_	_
called	_	_
.	_	_

They	_	_
are	_	_
the	_	_
only	_	_
place	_	_
I	_	_
would	_	_
_	take	_
my	_	_
car	_	_
peiod	_	_
.	_	_

_	take	_
a	_	_
laptop	_	_
in	_	_
for	_	_
a	_	_
_	video	_
cable	_	_
to	_	_
be	_	_
replaced	_	_
.	_	_

Everything	_	_
except	_	_
the	_	_
display	_	_
worked	_	_
fine	_	_
before	_	_
I	_	_
_	take	_
it	_	_
in	_	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
video	_	_
_	cable	_
was	_	_
replaced	_	_
and	_	_
suddenly	_	_
the	_	_
motherboard	_	_
was	_	_
dead	_	_
.	_	_

_	phone	_
calls	_	_
were	_	_
n't	_	_
returned	_	_
when	_	_
_	promise	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
botched	_	_
repair	_	_
took	_	_
a	_	_
week	_	_
longer	_	_
than	_	_
_	promise	_
.	_	_

We	_	_
have	_	_
_	stay	_
at	_	_
Tanglewood	_	_
for	_	_
many	_	_
years	_	_
now	_	_
.	_	_

We	_	_
go	_	_
over	_	_
about	_	_
5	_	_
_	time	_
a	_	_
year	_	_
.	_	_

We	_	_
have	_	_
never	_	_
had	_	_
a	_	_
problem	_	_
with	_	_
the	_	_
_	cabin	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
_	cabin	_
have	_	_
always	_	_
been	_	_
clean	_	_
.	_	_

Helen	_	_
is	_	_
a	_	_
wonderful	_	_
place	_	_
to	_	_
_	take	_
you	_	_
family	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
_	use	_
to	_	_
tan	_	_
down	_	_
the	_	_
street	_	_
before	_	_
I	_	_
was	_	_
referred	_	_
to	_	_
this	_	_
place	_	_
by	_	_
_	one	_
of	_	_
my	_	_
friends	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
did	_	_
n't	_	_
know	_	_
what	_	_
I	_	_
was	_	_
_	miss	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
lowest	_	_
_	bed	_
here	_	_
is	_	_
better	_	_
than	_	_
my	_	_
last	_	_
salon	_	_
s	_	_
highest	_	_
_	level	_
.	_	_

Great	_	_
People	_	_
and	_	_
even	_	_
better	_	_
_	service	_
!	_	_

In	_	_
a	_	_
few	_	_
_	word	_
...	_	_
I	_	_
'm	_	_
pleasantly	_	_
surprised	_	_
that	_	_
you	_	_
can	_	_
still	_	_
_	find	_
"	_	_
old	_	_
school	_	_
"	_	_
service	_	_
out	_	_
there	_	_
where	_	_
_	company	_
care	_	_
more	_	_
about	_	_
good	_	_
name	_	_
and	_	_
customers	_	_
than	_	_
their	_	_
_	pocket	_
...	_	_

Highly	_	_
recommended	_	_
_	people	_
/	_	_
business	_	_
.	_	_

If	_	_
possible	_	_
I	_	_
_	try	_
the	_	_
services	_	_
on	_	_
myself	_	_
before	_	_
I	_	_
_	bring	_
in	_	_
my	_	_
son	_	_
.	_	_

Neither	_	_
me	_	_
nor	_	_
my	_	_
son	_	_
have	_	_
n't	_	_
_	have	_
a	_	_
single	_	_
cavity	_	_
since	_	_
we	_	_
started	_	_
dental	_	_
_	care	_
there	_	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
_	team	_
focus	_	_
is	_	_
prevention	_	_
and	_	_
education	_	_
.	_	_

That	_	_
alone	_	_
_	make	_
them	_	_
unique	_	_
.	_	_

This	_	_
is	_	_
not	_	_
your	_	_
usual	_	_
cheap	_	_
_	hotdog	_
place	_	_
.	_	_

They	_	_
_	offer	_
a	_	_
large	_	_
variety	_	_
of	_	_
quality	_	_
_	hotdog	_
and	_	_
hamburgers	_	_
They	_	_
also	_	_
offer	_	_
veggie	_	_
_	dog	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
fries	_	_
are	_	_
of	_	_
good	_	_
quality	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
_	staff	_
is	_	_
friendly	_	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
atmosphere	_	_
is	_	_
your	_	_
typical	_	_
indie	_	_
_	outfit	_
with	_	_
old	_	_
movie	_	_
posters	_	_
and	_	_
memorabilia	_	_
from	_	_
the	_	_
70's	_	_
and	_	_
80's	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
_	use	_
my	_	_
card	_	_
to	_	_
purchase	_	_
a	_	_
_	meal	_
on	_	_
the	_	_
menu	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
total	_	_
on	_	_
my	_	_
_	receipt	_
was	_	_
$	_	_
8.95	_	_
but	_	_
when	_	_
I	_	_
went	_	_
on	_	_
_	line	_
to	_	_
check	_	_
my	_	_
transaction	_	_
it	_	_
_	show	_
$	_	_
10.74	_	_
.	_	_

There	_	_
is	_	_
something	_	_
wrong	_	_
or	_	_
maybe	_	_
the	_	_
individual	_	_
made	_	_
a	_	_
_	mistake	_
but	_	_
to	_	_
me	_	_
that	_	_
is	_	_
not	_	_
integrity	_	_
.	_	_

All	_	_
I	_	_
can	_	_
_	say	_
is	_	_
that	_	_
Elmira	_	_
you	_	_
are	_	_
the	_	_
best	_	_
I	_	_
ve	_	_
_	experience	_
,	_	_
never	_	_
before	_	_
has	_	_
the	_	_
seamstress	_	_
_	do	_
a	_	_
perfect	_	_
job	_	_
until	_	_
i	_	_
_	meet	_
you	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
_	recommend	_
you	_	_
to	_	_
everyone	_	_
in	_	_
Calgary	_	_
,	_	_
as	_	_
she	_	_
is	_	_
a	_	_
professional	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
_	cost	_
for	_	_
her	_	_
was	_	_
low	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
_	take	_
my	_	_
Mustang	_	_
here	_	_
and	_	_
it	_	_
_	look	_
amazing	_	_
after	_	_
they	_	_
were	_	_
done	_	_
,	_	_
they	_	_
did	_	_
a	_	_
great	_	_
_	job	_
,	_	_
I	_	_
'm	_	_
very	_	_
satisfied	_	_
with	_	_
the	_	_
_	result	_
.	_	_

The	_	_
paint	_	_
and	_	_
_	wheel	_
looked	_	_
like	_	_
glass	_	_
and	_	_
the	_	_
interior	_	_
_	look	_
new	_	_
!	_	_

Also	_	_
,	_	_
they	_	_
_	have	_
great	_	_
customer	_	_
service	_	_
and	_	_
a	_	_
very	_	_
knowledgeable	_	_
_	staff	_
